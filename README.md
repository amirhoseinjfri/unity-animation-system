üé¨ Say Goodbye to Animator Chaos!

Tired of animations interrupting each other like impatient toddlers? üò§
Sick of writing spaghetti coroutines just to play two clips in a row? üçù

AnimationController is here to save your sanity! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It‚Äôs a plug-and-play Unity tool that makes playing, queuing, looping, locking, and fading animations feel like magic ‚ú®‚Äîwithout the dark arts of Mecanim wizardry.

# üéÆ AnimationController for Unity

`AnimationController` is a powerful and flexible animation playback manager built on top of Unity's `Animator`. It provides easy-to-use APIs for controlling animations across multiple layers with support for:

‚úÖ Crossfade playback  
‚úÖ Looping and state chaining  
‚úÖ Interrupts and layer locking  
‚úÖ Returning to previous states  
‚úÖ Completion callbacks  
‚úÖ Cached parameter APIs for Blend Trees  
‚úÖ Coroutine-safe fade-outs

> üí° **Optimized for performance, robustness, and scalability in production games.**

## ‚ú® Features

- üîÅ Seamless animation chaining (queue-based)
- üîí Layer locking to prevent interruptions
- ‚è± Completion callbacks and automatic fade-outs
- ‚öôÔ∏è Cached hash lookups for parameters and states
- üéØ Fade and weight control for animation layers
- üßµ Coroutine-based execution with clean handling on disable



## üì¶ Installation

1. Copy the `AnimationController.cs` script into your Unity project's `Scripts` folder.
2. Attach it to any GameObject that has an `Animator` component.
3. Set up your Animator Controller with states and layers as needed.



## üöÄ Basic Usage

```csharp
public class CharacterController : MonoBehaviour
{
    private AnimationController _animCtrl;

    void Awake()
    {
        _animCtrl = GetComponent<AnimationController>();
    }

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
        {
            _animCtrl.Play("Jump", layer: 0, fadeDuration: 0.2f);
        }

        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.R))
        {
            _animCtrl.Play("Run", loop: true);
        }
    }
}
````


## üß† Advanced Usage

### Queue animations with callbacks

```csharp
_animCtrl.Queue("DrawSword", onComplete: () =>
{
    Debug.Log("Sword drawn, now attacking!");
    _animCtrl.Queue("Attack");
});
```

### Locking layers until animation completes

```csharp
_animCtrl.Play("PowerUp", lockLayer: true, onComplete: () =>
{
    Debug.Log("Power-up done, now idle.");
    _animCtrl.Play("Idle");
});
```

### Returning to previous looping state after a non-looping one

```csharp
_animCtrl.Play("Run", loop: true);
_animCtrl.Queue("HitReact", returnToPrevious: true);
```

### Blend tree parameter control

```csharp
_animCtrl.SetFloat("Speed", 0.8f);
_animCtrl.SetBool("IsGrounded", true);
```

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Play(string stateName, int layer, float fadeDuration, bool loop, bool returnToPrevious, bool lockLayer, Action onComplete)` | Plays an animation immediately. Interrupts the current animation if not locked. |
| `Queue(string stateName, ...)`                                                                                               | Queues an animation after the current one finishes.                             |
| `InterruptLayer(int layer, float fadeOutDuration, bool force)`                                                               | Interrupts a layer, clearing its queue and optionally fading out its weight.    |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Use **looping + returnToPrevious** for reactive states like hit-reactions or dodges.
* Use **locking** for non-interruptible animations like special moves or transformations.
* Use **fadeOutDuration** in `InterruptLayer()` to avoid harsh cut-offs.
* Avoid mixing too many **layer weights** without proper fading to prevent blending artifacts.
* Always provide a **default looping state** to fall back to (like Idle or Run).

---

## üîß Requirements

* Unity 2020.3 or later
* Animator component with states configured
